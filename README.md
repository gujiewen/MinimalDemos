# MinimalDemos
This Git repository contains a collection of minimal how-to demos. When I need to implement something for work, it's frustrating to spend a long time searching without finding any instructive code. Most of the time, code that implements a feature requires a bunch of libraries, which is annoying. Therefore, I hope for a demo that is sufficiently small, sufficiently naive to demonstrate the functionality.
